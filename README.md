👨‍🏫   About Me

a dedicated student enrolled in the Software Engineering program at Daffodil International University. I am an enthusiastic and engaged member of both the Software Engineering Club (SEC) and the Data Science Club (DS). In my academic journey, I continuously seek opportunities to expand my knowledge base, driven by an insatiable appetite for learning.
As an individual, I have embraced leadership roles within various teams and groups. While my path has been marked by both successes and failures, I consider each experience a valuable lesson that contributes to my growth. Beyond my academic and club involvement, I aspire to cut a path toward becoming a proficient Data Scientist. My passion for learning extends to acquiring developer skills, sharpening my coding ability, and fostering a deep understanding of various facts of the field.
Though my initial aspiration was to pursue a career as a cricketer for Bangladesh, I have recognized the immense potential within the realm of IT. By dedicating myself to becoming an IT specialist, I am driven to contribute meaningfully to the community while exploring innovative avenues.
